    /*
    d3
        References the D3 object, so we can access its methods.

    .select("#dy-canvas")
        Give the select() method a CSS selector as input, and it will return a reference to the first element in the DOM that matches. (Use selectAll() when you need more than one element.) In this case, we want the #dy-canvas div of the document, so a reference to this div is handed off to the next method in our chain.

    .append("p")
        append() creates whatever new DOM element you specify and appends it to the end (but just inside) of whatever selection itâ€™s acting on. In our case, we want to create a new p within the body. We specified "p" as the input argument, but this method also sees the reference to #dy-canvas div that was passed down the chain from the select() method. So an empty p paragraph is appended to the div. Finally, append() hands off a reference to the new element it just created.

    .text("New paragraph!")
        text() takes a string and inserts it between the opening and closing tags of the current selection. Because the previous method passed down a reference to our new p, this code just inserts the new text between <p> and </p>. (In cases where there is existing content, it will be overwritten.)

    ;
        The all-important semicolon indicates the end of this line of code. Chain over.
